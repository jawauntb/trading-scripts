# trading-scripts
A compilation of custom scripts, strategies, and indicators I've built over the years for trading and investing with TradingView and Robinhood.

## Overview
I've been developing these scripts for over two years, experimenting with a variety of strategies to find an edge in the market, improve my understanding of technical analysis (TA) and quantitative analysis (QA), and optimize my trading strategies for Robinhood and TradingView. This work has really helped to enhance my trading skills and has provided me with deeper insights into market behaviors, quantitative analysis and technical analysis, as well as the design of indicators and strategies. Each script contributes to a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing market dynamics, identifying trading opportunities, and managing risk in various market conditions.
